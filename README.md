# AlgoBharat Live Hack Submission Template

Welcome to the official submission format for the **Live Hack Challenge**.

---

## 🔀 How to Participate

You can choose **one of two submission approaches**:

### Option 1: Build a Complete Project
🎯 Think of a real-world project like:
- 🕹️ A game with in-game currency
- 🎓 University certificate issuance
- 🏥 Hospital records using tokens
- 💳 Rewards/loyalty system, etc.

Implement the 7 challenge tasks within that project.  
📈 The more tasks your project covers, the more points you earn.  
✅ **Ideal scenario**: Project implements **all 7 tasks** → max score.

If you go with this option:
- Create **one repository**
- Mention in the `README.md`:
  - What the project is
  - Which tasks (1-7) are implemented
- Add all related code inside the project folder
- Include your final demo video link(5–8 min)

---

### Option 2: Submit Individual Tasks
Don't want to build a complete project? No problem!

✅ You can choose to implement **any of the 7 tasks individually**,  
based on your/team's capabilities.

Use the provided folder structure (below), and:
- Put code, screenshots, notes in each relevant task folder
- Add a final demo video explaining what you've implemented

## 📁 Folder Structure (for Task-Based Approach)

If you're doing individual tasks, use this format:
├── Task-1-Create-Token/
├── Task-2-Metadata-Control/
├── Task-3-Smart-Contract/
├── Task-4-Multisig/
├── Task-5-Application/
├── Task-6-Advanced-Features/
├── Task-7-Innovation/
