# ðŸ§  AlgoBharat Live Hack â€“ Submission Template

Welcome to the official submission template for the **Live Hack Challenge**.

You can choose one of the two submission paths below:

---

## âœ… Submission Options

### Option 1: Full Project Submission (`project_name/`)
Build a complete project such as a game, university certificate system, healthcare solution, etc., where you implement some or all of the 7 tasks as part of a **real-world use case**.

**What to do:**
- Create your project `project_name/` folder.
- Add your code, assets, and documentation.
- Include a `README.md` inside `project_name/` explaining:
  - What your project does
  - Which of the 7 tasks youâ€™ve implemented
- Include a **final demo video link (5â€“8 mins)** showcasing your implementation.

**Ideal Case:**  
If your project implements **all 7 tasks**, youâ€™ll get **maximum points**, as each task has assigned scores.

---

### Option 2: Task-Based Submission (`tasks_only/`)
If you're not building a full project, you can directly complete individual tasks (1â€“7) as standalone exercises.

**What to do:**
- Navigate to the `tasks_only/` folder.
- Inside, you'll find subfolders for each task.
- Complete any number of tasks based on your capabilities.
- Add your code and a brief `README.md` inside each completed task folder.
- Include a **final demo video (5â€“8 mins)** where you walk through which tasks youâ€™ve completed and how.
